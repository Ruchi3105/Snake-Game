# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with Java Swing! This project is perfect for learning the fundamentals of game development and object-oriented programming in Java.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay
- Simple and clean UI design
- Scoring system
- Game Over detection

## How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys** to move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
2. Eat the red food block to grow the snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body. If you do, it's Game Over!

## Running the Game

### Using IDE

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Run the `App.java` file.

### Using Terminal

1. Compile the files:
   ```bash
   javac App.java SnakeGame.java
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java App
   ```

## Code Overview

### App.java

This file sets up the main JFrame and initializes the SnakeGame panel.

### SnakeGame.java

This is the core logic of the game, handling:

- Game rendering
- Snake movement and collision
- Food placement
- Key inputs for controlling the snake
- Game Over logic

---

## Customization

### Board Size

You can customize the board size by changing the `boardWidth` and `boardHeight` variables in `App.java`:

```java
int boardWidth = 600;  // Change this value
int boardHeight = boardWidth;  // Keep this equal for a square board
```

### Speed

Adjust the game speed by modifying the timer delay in `SnakeGame.java`:

```java
Timer gameLoop = new Timer(150, this);  // Lower value = faster speed
```
